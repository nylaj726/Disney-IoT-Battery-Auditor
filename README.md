# Disney-IoT-Battery-Auditor
Python-based diagnostic tool for auditing battery health across Disney park IoT devices to automate maintenance ticketing.
# Disney IoT Infrastructure: Battery Health Auditor 🔋

## Project Overview
In a large-scale environment like Disney Parks, keeping IoT devices (MagicBand scanners, touchpoints, and mobile sensors) operational is a major IT challenge. This script automates the process of checking device health and flagging systems that require immediate maintenance before they fail.

## Features
* **Automated Diagnostics:** Scans device logs for battery levels.
* **Smart Alerting:** Categorizes devices as "Healthy," "Low," or "Critical."
* **Ticketing System:** Automatically generates a maintenance report for devices below the 20% threshold.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **System Administration:** Lifecycle management of hardware assets.
* **Python Programming:** Use of nested lists, conditional logic, and list appending for data collection.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing "Guest friction" by preventing hardware downtime.
